you get the idea:
basically break the day up into 3 parts, each around 4-5 hours long, and fill each part with a mission.

1) spent, wasted playing videogames
2) get supporting materials together, read papers, and whatnot
3) write rough draft of introduction, and send it to mom. perhaps she can help me make sense of this
